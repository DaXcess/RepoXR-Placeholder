# R.E.P.O. VR Mod Placeholder

This repo(sitory) is a temporary placeholder for the R.E.P.O. VR mod

Progress is slow than usual, as I do not have a lot of free time on my hands, and the free time I do have, I have to balance between building the mod, playing other games (Outer Wilds is pretty awesome), and playing games with friends (ironically, R.E.P.O. is one of them).

The R.E.P.O. devs decided to reinvent the way UI interactions work (manual screen cursor to canvas position checking, instead of just using an onhover event), so that's a bit annoying to deal with right now. I have some of the basic interactions already set up, but some buttons do not work yet (can't select an existing save).

I'm currently working on implementing the rebinding system. Yes, I know that the game has a built-in rebinding system, but it's kind of meh. The settings menu for it is not dynamic, and they manually create all InputActions using `new InputAction("<binding>");`. I'm working on rebuilding this to just use an `InputActionAsset`, which is eventually placed in a `PlayerInput`.

That's it for now.
